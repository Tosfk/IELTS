# 2. Procedure(during exam)
考官基本都会让考生讲两分钟，平时准备的时候朝着两分半到三分钟。
有一分钟思考以及做笔记 

考官说：
```
Instructions
Before you get the card, the examiner says:
"Now I'm going to give you a topic, and I'd like for you to talk about it for 1 to 2 minutes. Before you talk, you have 1 minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes if you wish. Do you understand?
Here's some paper and pencil for for making notes, and here's your topic. Please don't write anything on the booklet. i'd likeyou to talk about ...
```
1. 考官给你话题卡
2. 考官给你 1min 准备，可以提前但不建议。
3. 一分钟后考官让你停下
4. 考官告诉你开始说这个话题

Examiner says:
```
Alright, remember you have 1-2 minutes for this, so don't worry if I stop you. l'll tell you when the time is up. Can you start speaking now, please?
```

考官让你说就立刻开始作答，不然会影响流利度。
p2 提前说完才不正常，尽量多说，他不在乎你答不答得完

5. 考官将在1-2min后打断你
Examiner says:
```
Okay, thank you.
```

6. 考官会简单问你个过渡性的问题 (following question)
Examiner says:
```
Do you often contact this person?
```
You say: 
Yes / No.

## NOTE
过渡性问题——
- 不需要给一个完整的答案
- 不需要给细节
- 不需要理解问题
- 不需要说"pardon"
- 只说 YES or NO

move on 时才代表p3开始。

## Quick Recap
p2着重考
- **Fluency and Coherence**
  - 停顿 language-related pause
  - 重复 repetion
  - 纠错 self-correction，说错了要改，但不要太多
  - 明确的语篇标记 discourse markers 
  - 更自然 connectives 逻辑更强
  - fast ！= fluent
- **Pronunciation**
  - clarity 清晰度
  - intonation 升降起伏
  - sentence stress 强调，拖长
  - word stress 单词重音
- Grammatical Range and Accuracy
- Lexical Resources

一个人讲两分钟，很容易讲到一分钟的时候语调会变平

### Basic Requirements
1. 立即开口
2. 保持 ball rolling，不断说下去
3. 保持情感 speak with feeling
4. stop when examiner tells you to.
5. 不要自己说“that's all”并自己解说

## Reminders for P2
- 有1 full minute 记笔记
- 2分钟内话题不必完成
- 被打断是正常的
- 不要换新话题
- 考官不能解释
- 和考官对视可以，但不是必须的
- 考官可能也谨慎涣散了，没事，不代表什么
