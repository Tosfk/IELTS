# 2. Basis Answer Structure

## The TS + SD Principle
Answer
- <font color="#ff0000">T</font>opic <font color="#ff0000">S</font>entence
- <font color="#ff0000">S</font>upporting <font color="#ff0000">D</font>etails
### Why use this?
**Topic Sentence**
to give a clear, simple, <font color="#ff0000">direct</font> answer

**Supporting Details**
to elaborate and make your meaning <font color="#ff0000">clear</font>
to<font color="#ff0000"> communacate effectively</font>
to show your linguistic ability

### Topic Sentence
- no need to repeat the question - 除非问的复杂或没听清
- no need to paraphrase(解释) the question  -也不用替换

- **MUST** answer accordingly

<br />
Do you like to swim?
- Yes, I do.  

Where is your hometown?
- Lanzhou.

Which do you prefer, tea or coffee?
- I like coffee better.

Would you continue to live there?
- No, l don't think so.

**A clear, direct topic sentence is important.**  
**Supporting details are also important!**  

## Example of ineffective communication  
**Q: How is the roast chicken? l spent all day making it.**    
**A:** It's good.  

**Q: How is the roast chicken?  l spent all day making it.**  
**A:** It's really good. In fact, l think it's the best chicken I've ever had! It's crispy on the outside, but it's juicy on the inside. This is much better than the chicken we had at that restaurant last week, l bet if you sell this, you'll give them a run for their money.

主动多给内容  
既然要加细节，那加什么呢？  
let's **brainstorming**——

# 3. Brainstorming
分析：

It's really good. *(topic sentence)*

 In fact, l think it's the best chicken *(opinion)* I've ever had! It's crispy on the outside, but it's juicy on the inside *(description)*. This is much better than the chicken *(comparisob)* we had at that restaurant last week, l bet if you sell this *(prediction)* , you'll give them a run for their money.

 so,  
 How to add details

 - Opinion    
 - Description    
 - Comparison   
 - Prediction   
 - Reason
   - good
   - bad
 - Example
 - Result
 - Reference (借别人之口说话，不想过多解释，我听说)

没话说的时候，比较，预测，结果任意一个又能说三四个

## Templates for reference
雅思口语比较灵活，用模板可能会限制住，所以模板建议模仿而不是照背。  
刚开始完全没有思路的情况下可以使用模板，or自己拼凑模板

- TS + reason +example + another reason + opinion
- TS + reason + comparison + details
- TS + opinion + description + prediction

<br />

- TS + reason +example + another reason + opinion

**Q: Do you like your living area?**  
A: Yes, very much,*（TS）*  
because living here is pretty convenient *(reason)*  
There's a bus stop right at the door, and the metro station is only a block away. *(example)*  
Alse, the environment is quite nice, there are lots of trees and flowers, and you never see any trash on the ground, *(another reason)*  
so I think it's a great neighborhood to live in. *(opinion)*

- TS + reason + comparison + details

**Q: Do you like your living area?**  
A: Yes, very much,  
because living here is pretty convenient. There's a bus stop right at the door, and the metro station is only a block away. *(reason)*  
The area I used to live in was in the suburbs, and transportation was a headache. *(comparision)*  
Everyday when I went to work, I had to cycle for about 15 minutes to get to the metro station. *(details)*

- TS + opinion + description + prediction

**Q: Do you like your living area?**  
A: Yes, very much,  
in fact, I think it's a great neighborhood to live in. *(opinion)*  
There's a bus stop right at the door, and the metro station is only a block away, the environment is quite nice, there are lots of trees and flowers, and you never see any trash on the ground. *(description)*  
I think I'm going to live here for a really long time. *(prediction)*

## Template for "NO" Answers

- No + reason + opinion + prediction + result

鼓励说no，有些经历确实没有，编出来也不自然  
比如“观鸟”，对大部分中国孩子来说都没有这个经历 

reason：  
城市里面鸟的种类不是很多  
小时候作业多  
长大了也没什么兴趣了  

opinion： 
boring  

prediction： 
所以可能有时间也不会去看了。

例子：  
Q: Have you ever been on a picnic before?  
A: Um, no, (NO)  
because picnic aren't really a thing in China, and we're not huge fans of picnic foods like sandwiches, it's too "cold" for the stomach. (reason)  
But I think picnics seem like a lot of fun, (opinion)  
so maybe this summer, I'll call some friends and we'll try it. (prediction)  
I think we'll have a good time together. (result) 

aren't really a thing 我们不兴这个
强调 cold 可以前后停顿，语气拉长，too coooold

ok，下一节讲 reservoir of ideas（万金油，观点库）

# 4. Reservoir of Ideas
## Reservoir 
- Time
- Money
- Health (身体&精神)
- Relationship
- Emotions
- Experience
- Environment
- Culture
- Pressure
- Convenience

How to use the reservoir?

**Q: Do you like to travel by car?**  
A: Well, it depends on **how long** *(time)* the trip is. If the trip is under an hour, I'm ok with it, but if the ride takes 4 or 5 hours, or even a day, I'd prefer to travel by train or by plane. It might be more **expensive** *(money)* , but I prefer it, cause it's much faster, and it saves a lot time.

**Q: What kind of food do you like to eat for barbecue?**  
A: I like everything, but my favorites are beef, chicken wings, and broccoli(西兰花). They're delicious, and pretty healthy, too. You get **protein and vitamins and fibers, there's not a lot of fat** *(health)* if you brush on only a little bit of oil. Oh, I also like pig intestines (猪肠). I know it **sounds disgusting** *(emotion)*, but a lot of people love it, it's an important part of **food culture** *(culture)* in China.
