P12 定档 P3 决定分数



## 3. Grading Criteria

>Fluency and Coherence - 流利性和连贯性 -不卡  
>Pronunciation - 发音 ，顿挫，强调，有节奏  so~cute  
>Lexical Resources - 词汇  不用太复杂的  
>Grammatical Rangeand Accuracy - 语法范围和准确性 -不需要太复杂

### 3.1 Fluency and Coherence
#### “4-3-2 法则”
1. 第一遍慢吞吞的说四分钟
2. 纠正内容练好以后，缩减到三分钟，去掉卡的时间，可能一卡就是十几秒
3. 复盘以后，最后一遍两分钟，精简语言
练15个，重复的东西很多，重复去说，提高流利度
复述 ！= 背，不需要

雅思口语的灵魂——
一定要**多说**，说少了不好给分
主动给考官提供更多信息

有犯错空间，连贯性靠连接词和语篇标记来支撑

**Dos**
- Speak at length
- Use connectives and discourse markers flexibly
- Develop topic well  

**Don'ts**  
- Repeat and self-correct frequently
- Have a lot of languag-related hesitation
- Over-use connectives and discourse markers
- Use connectives and discourse markers wrong

<br />

> Q: Do you like eating fish?
- Yes, of course, l love it.
- No, l don't, cause it smells, and there are way too many bones.

以上回答都不是很好，未主动提供信息

**Acceptable Length:**
No, l don't, cause **it smells**, and there are **way too many bones**. **Every time l go by the seafood market, the smell of fish just makes me want to throw up**, and **l really hate the bones, you know when l was a kid, a fish bone got stuck in my throat, and I ended up in the hospital. It was a complete nightmare**, and it's one of the main reasons why l dislike eating fish.

时间不够，加粗句子二选一

throw up  
got stuck in my throat  
ended up  

**summary**

- uses a range of <font color="#ff0000">connectives and discourse markers</font> flexibly
- <font color="#ff0000">some</font> hesitation, repetition, or self-correction

### 3.2 Pronunciation
这两点短期内很难改变

being intelligible and clear is the most important

- must pronounce vowels right  元音必须发好 wake week
- can be slow yet also fluent
- intonation matters a lot 语调
- practice word stress and sentence stress 重音 
- pause where needed (clear meaning) 合理停顿

### 3.3 Lexical Resources

I absolutely adore buying bags, which is the most significant reason behind my action of looking at bags from brands of luxury whenever l travel to the mall. However, it is a pity that my savings are not so sufficient as to afford such items, which leads to the result that for the time being, l can only window shop. （太刻意太书面）

5. 但不适合我，but
