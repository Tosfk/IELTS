### 生词
单词 |意思
---|---

### 改错
1. D为干扰项，`I’d been  working in London as a website designer, but although that was interesting, I didn’t like city life. `。
2. `It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a generous member of the public who’d lived here all her life. `
3. `I used to be short-sighted, so I’d had to wear glasses, but I’d had laser eye surgery two years earlier so that was OK. ` 注意听but，排除b。`They gave me tests for colour blindness and they thought I might have a problem there, but it turned out I was OK.`日了
4. 细节题，了解流程
6. `so I speak to youth groups and sailing clubs in the area about the sorts of problems that sailors and swimmers can have if the weather suddenly gets bad. `
7. 细节。本题需要选出David关于救生艇志愿者培训所说的两方面内容。原文首先提到it’s given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without panicking，对应C选项的have built up his mental strength，该选项为正确答案之一。需要考生理解confidence和without panicking的含义。下一句出现D选项的casualty care activities，但未提及challenging。B选项的ropes和knots原词出现，但原文We’ve done a lot和选项中brief不符。接下来出现A选项的residential course，但原文仅提到专家授课，并未提及leadership。随后出现E选项的wave tank，后文get experience at what to do if the boat turned over in a storm at night即选项中的practice in survival techniques，因此可确定E选项为另一个正确答案。此处原文为具体例子，选项则较为概括抽象，需要考生具备一定的理解能力和概括能力。

### 总结：
抽象

invertebrate|无脊椎动物

5. The tardigrade’s mouth is a kind of tube that can open outwards to reveal teeth-like structures known as ‘stylets’.
