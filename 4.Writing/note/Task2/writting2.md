## P1
We cannot deny the fact that almost any form of writing can now be stored and accessed electronically, which leads some to argue that we do not need paper books anymore. However, as far as **reading experience, health, and affordability** are concerned, we still need paper books now and in the future. (52 words)

1. `be stored and accessed electronically`: 以电子形式存储和读取

## P2
First, paper books are definitely needed **since they provide a UNIQUE reading experience**, which helps us build a stronger impression on the reading material. To be more specific, the natural experience of holding a book, flipping the pages and making progress, and the smell of paper all contribute to an immersive psychological experience of reading, encouraging us to focus on the information conveyed by the book; (in addition, the convenience of flipping pages to different chapters and making notes on paper further enhances the reading experience of paper books.) (89 words)

2. `build a stronger impression on the reading material`: 对阅读材料建立更深的印象。
3. `immersive psychological experience of reading`: 沉浸的阅读心理体验

## P3 健康
Second, the fact that use of paper books is **healthier than electronic books** for children indicates that we still need them. As a human nature, younger kids develop their cognitive abilities through the physical interaction with objects, including books. Thus, the conventional experience of reading paper books is also an experience of exploration for kids. In contrast, light-emitting screens not only might impair children's vision but also compromise proper psychological development. (77 words)

## P4 让步拉回

Still, some might claim that the convenience in storing and accessing digital information will eventually eliminate paper books. Ironically, or surprisingly, paper books are **more affordable and accessible** to many as we do not need to purchase any fragile and expensive device, and can even borrow for free from libraries, which promotes education and social equality in impoverished areas of the world. (62 words)
In concluion, paper books still play and will play a vital role in the world we live in, and they will not be replace by electronic forms of information. (23 words)

8. `promotes education and social equality in impoverished areas of the world.`: 促进世界贫困地区的教育和社会平等
9. `electronic forms of information.`: 电子形式的信息
