**Summary**
- What's the framework?

The two bar charts demonstrate the career choices (excluding full-time work) of graduate students and postgraduate students in the UK in 2008. The choice include part-time work, voluntary work, further study, and unemployment.

不用特意对数据进行分组，本身已是两大组数据

Among approximately 67,000 graduates, a few percent less than half chose to pursue further study, accounting for the largest proportion. In the meantime, part-time work and unemployment both took around a quarter of the total. In contrast, voluntary work was the least popular option, occupying a mere 5%.

Postgraduate followed a pattern with some similarity to graduates in 2008, though in a much smaller scale. Among approcimately 7,000 of them, further study was again the most popular option, which accounted for around 30% of the total; unlike graduates, significantly more postgraduates chose part-time work than unemployment, standing at 2,535 and 1,625 respectively. Voluntary work was also again the least favorable choice at about 5%.

> similarity 相似性，相似点

关键点：conclusion

表达清楚两幅图之间的联系

In conclusion, the non-fulltime job preferences of graduates and postgraduate in the UK were in totally different scales, but shared some similar feathres.

分析练习：

**Summary**
- What's the framework?  

**Chart 1**
- Burgers & Pizza + income level  *汉堡与披萨随着收入增长而增长*  
- Fish and Chips? income level *此趋势不明显 中等收入人群反而高* 
 
**Chart 2**
- Burgers & Pizza +++  *这几年翻了好几倍*
- Fish and Chips - *国菜的消耗量没怎么变*

**Conclusion**
- Connection between charts
- 汉堡和皮萨的消耗量和收入挂钩，正相关
- 汉堡和皮萨的消耗量在这几十年持续上升
- 国菜轻微下降
- 英国在这几十年里有可能收入上升
