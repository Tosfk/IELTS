# 1.Line Graph
Line graphs show numbers changing over a period of time.  
usually [2, 5] line,  
Your job is to compare the lines,not describe them separately.  

**First**, make a very general comparison. (summary/overview paragraph)  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tosfk/Image/main/20250927194958268.png)

the blue line is the highest overall. higher than the other lines.  

**Second**, compare the line at specific points.('details' paragraphs) 

write ar least one thing about each line. 

## Example
The graph below shows electricity producition(in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012.

### Introduction  
**change some words：**  
- The graph below shows --> The line graph compares
- electricity producition --> the amount of electricity produced
- [plus information from graph] --> using four different sources of power
- between 1980 and 2012 --> over a period of 32 years  

<br/>
“The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.”

### Overview-2 sentences, 2 main points
origin line is highest, and the green line is the lowest.

“It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown.”

> by far 大大地

“Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.”

完成第二段，讲了最高和最低的

### Details -2 paragraphs, compare the lines
**Paragraph 3**   

介绍各个能源的初始值————  
In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power.  

Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount.

Just one year later, nuclear power overtake thermal power as the primary source of electricity.

> overtake 赶超

> **Attention：** Important tip when describing numbers
> nuclear is not a n.
> You can't write:  
>   Nuclear was 75 terawatt hours of electricity.  
>   Nuclear produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.  
> You must write:  
>   Nuclear power was used to produce 75 terawatthours of electricity.  
>   Nuclear power stations produced 75 terawatthours of electricity.
