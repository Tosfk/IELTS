### Line Graph

Step 1 - Summary  
**What is the general trend?**  
We find the <font color="#ff0000">general</font> trend goes up!

Step 2 - Grouping  
what is the <font color="#ff0000">major</font> commonalities and differences between trends?

> commonality     /ˌkɑməˈnæləti/
> n. 共性；共同特征


分为两组，r 起点高，有波折  
t & l 起点低，比起r，和l更加接近  
有比较大的共性就能分到一起

Step 3 - Analysis

作报告时，先把大框架说清，what's the framework?  
这幅图描述了人们为什么会从城市离开，the main reason people gave for moving away from a particular capital city to the countryside. 描述了这一现象  
趋势是越来越多的人离开了，general trend is more and more people leave capital.  

G1解释为什么这样分组，和其中的特色


#### Summary
- What's the framework?
- What's the general trend?

自己写：  
This line graph shows the change about the reason why people leave their particular capital to countryside from 1990 to 2020. From the graph we can find that there are three line which stands the rising cost of living, traffic and lifestyle of those people.

**范文：**  
The line graph <font color="#245bdb">demonstrates</font> the main motivations people <font color="#ff0000">expressed</font> for relocating to the countryside from the urban area of a capital city in 1990, 2000 and 2010.
The years <font color="#ff0000">witnessed</font> a large number of people moving away.  

与两个问题对应

> demonstrate v.证明；演示；示范；论证；表现；说明；证实；表达；表露；显露；集会示威  
> relocating v. 搬迁，迁移重新安置；  
> express 表达  
> urban area 市区  
> witness  n.证人；见证；目击者；v. 见证；作证；是…的迹象  
> a large number of 大量，许多


**要注意:**
- 事态 tense - 所有的事都发生在过去
- 换词，不能照抄，同义替换要体现 paraphrasing（释义；意译；改写）
	- show - demonstrate
	- reasons - main motivations
	- gave - express
- framework：two axes
	- 原因和年份，年份比较多则 between
- general trend：


#### Group 1
- Why grouping (commonality)?
- Comparison and key features

因为rising cost of living 数值高，特点突出，故分为单独一组

**Practice Checkpoint**  
（为什么分组）因为这个生活成本这一曲线数量较另外两者明显较高，且变化趋势曲折。cuz the amount of rising cost of living is obsivior than the others, and the trends is characteristic what have a bind in the middle. 确实不知道怎么说了

**例文：**  
According to the graph, the major reason for relocation was the the rising cost of living.   
In 1990, 65,000 people left the city because of this, then the number peaked at 85,000 in 2000, before going down a bit by 5,000 in the decade between 2000 and 2010.

> peak n. 高峰；尖形 v. 达到峰值，高峰 adj. 高峰时期的，巅峰状态的  
> before ?

为什么这么分，只有一条线所以不用分析线与线之间的异同，

**注意：**
- tense
- why grouping 
- key features of 折线图 
	- beginnings, ends, turning points, intersections(交汇点), high & lows

TA：
1. **Why grouping (commonality)?**  
	the major reason for relocation

2. Comparison and **key features**  
	第二段全是描述其特性


#### Group 2
- Why grouping (commonality)?
- Comparison and key features

PC:  
两者都是次要原因，且变化趋势相同。  
Both the line on trafic and lifestyle is the second reason why people leaving, and the have a familiar strat point 20,000 when 1900 and trend which is goes up. The reason of traffic increasing to 3400 then went to 6,000 sharply. And the lifestyle linearly wnet form 30,000 to 40,000 from 2000 to 2010.

**范文：**  
It was different story for traffic and lifestyle: both had the same munber of city leavers at 20,000 at the start of the period, much lower than that of rising cost of living. Subsequently, both categories saw increases, with traffic first going up by a large nunber to 35,000 by the year 2000, and then even more steeply to 60,000 by 2010; Lifestyle leavers rose consistently over the whole period, going eventually up to 40,000.

分为三组，一组变化较大的，一组变化较小的，bonus/group3 补充半路开始的

这图看起来难受
转化为折线图

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tosfk/Image/main/Pasted%20image%2020250327095432.png)

方框内的内容较高，所以分为一组

framework：一个年份，一个人数  
trend：无规律，diffrent

分组：
1. 英国和新西兰一组，都在上升，英国一直上升，澳洲先降再升
2. 澳洲美国加拿大一组，一直在震荡，没有明显趋势
or 分三组
