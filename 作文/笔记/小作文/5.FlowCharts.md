> The diagrams below show the stages and equipment used in the cement-making process, and how cement is used to produce concrete for building purpose.


The two flow charts demonstrate the stage and equipment used for cement production, and how cement is further processed into concrete.


## Phase 1  
  - Step 

**5.5-6.0 version**

First, a crusher processes limestone and clay into powder. Then the powder goes though a mixer and rotating heater. After that, the mixture goes on a grinder and is made into cement. Finally, cement is packed into bags. - 37 words

For flow charts
- ==Detailed== & Clear
- Replicatable
- Without personalopinion

要有更多细节

**7.0 version - more details**

First, a crusher *combines and process* limestone and clay into powder, which then goes through a mixer *for further mixing*. After that, the mixture goes *via a pipe* into a *cylindrical* rotating heater and *is melted*. The melted mixture then *drops onto a conveyor belt* before being ground into cement. Finally, loose cement is packed into bags.

生词|意思
---|---
limestone|石灰岩
clay|粘土
powder|粉尘
cylindrical|圆柱形的
heater|加热器
melted|熔化
conveyor belt|传送带
being ground into|被碾成
loose|宽松的

如何增强描述性——
1. purpose of the steps?  //每一步的目的
2. actions in the steps?
3. shape, sizes, and other features of the items?
4. relationships between steps and phase? // 两个步骤之间的关系

**7.0 + version - more details**

First, a crusher *with two tilted surface* receives limestone and clay, **combining and crushing the raw materials into powder for further processing.** The powder then enters a mixer *to achieve a higher level of homogeneity*. After that, the mixture goes via a pipe into a large cylindrical rotating heater *(with an external heat source)* and is melted. The melted mixture drops down from the heater onto a conveyor belt before being sent for grinding into cement. Finally, loose cement is packed into bags. - 83 words

---|---
tilted| 倾斜的
crush|压碎
homogeneity|均匀性，同质，同种


## Phase 2  
  - Step 

**5.5-6.0 version - basic procedures**

Cement is then used for making concrete. 15% of cement is mixed with 10% of water, 25% sand, and 50% of gravel (small tones). The mixture goes into a concrete mixer. Then concrete is done.  - 35 words


**6.0 -6.5 version - more details**
In the second phase, cement is then *used for the production of concrete*: 15% of cement is mixed with 10% of water, 25% sand, and 50% of gravel (small tones) *before they are sent into a mixer*. Then concrete is finished *for construction purposes*.  - 52 words


**7.0 + version - more details**
In the second phase, cement is then used for the production of concrete, and *the first step is to create a mixture:* 15% of cement *is poured out from the bags*, 10% of water *from a pipe*, 25% sand and 50% of gravel (small tones) are *shoveled*. The ingredients are then all sent into a *gigantic cylindrical rotating* mixer. *Once the mixture is adequately stirred*, it forms concrete which can be used for construction purpose.

生词|原型|意思
---|---
poured out from||倾泻而出
poured|pour|倾倒，喷发
gravel|砾石
shoveled|shovel|铲子，铲起
ingredients|ingredient|成分，原料，要素

## Tones in flow charts:

The diagram shows the process of making Wesaklanterns, which Sri Lankans do to celebrate thefestival of Wesak in May each year.

**Instructive tone:**  
To begin with, *you need to cut* 25 bamboo sticks to a length of 25cm each. *We then tie* four of them together to make a square - this process has to be repeated until six squares are made.

**Descriptive tone:**  
To begin with, 25 bamboo sticks are cut into to a length of 25cm each. Four of them are then tied together to make a square - this process has to be repeated until six squares are made.

实际考试中都可以。描述性的语气更方便。

总结：
- 流程图又简单又难——简单在不需要总结，难在**细节**描述。
