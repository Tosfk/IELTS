**着重分析：**
- 注重数据之间的异同
- 数据组别之内和数据组别之间

Step 1 - Summary
- what info is presented?

Step 2  - Grouping
- what are the <font color="#ff0000">major</font> commonalities and differences between quantities?

summary: 数据组别是否有共性  
分组并对分的组别进行讨论，分成了两大组

第一种 店里喝茶

先看这一组的内部关系  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tosfk/Image/main/Pasted%20image%2020250327151751.png)

可以看出，更多的是共性，阿德莱德在低位，可以看作exception  
大多数人都在店里喝过饮料  
共性是都很高  

组别之间差异：

速溶或新鲜咖啡的比例低于去店里，  
得出去店里和咖啡这一行为更加普遍

再看第二组内部对比  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tosfk/Image/main/Pasted%20image%2020250327152246.png)

整体上说大家买了更多的速溶咖啡，整体上一组高于另一组  
ok，开写  

**Summary**
- What's the framework?

**Group 1**
- Why grouping (commonality)?
- Comparison and key features

**Group 2**

**Conclusion (bonus)**
- Additional information or reasonable interpretation


**practice checkpoint:**  
This bar chart shows the differences about coffee and tea buying and drinking habits in Australia.We can see the percentages of citizens choice fresh coffee, instant coffee or went to cafe.   
From the chart we can comprehension that most people want to drink coffe or tea in cafe. The percentage is about 60% average. The biggest is Melboune which is 63% and the lowest is Adelaide 50%. It is obviously higher than the others.
And the poeple who choice drink coffee both made by fresh and instant is lower.

**Sample:**  
The bar chart demonstrates the coffee-and-tea buying and drinking preferences of residents in five Australian cities. It shows the proportion of residents who bought fresh or instant coffee, and those that went to a cafe for coffee or tea in the last four weeks.

The bar chart <font color="#245bdb">demonstrates</font> the coffee-and-tea buying and <u>drinking preferences</u> of residents in <u>five Australian cities</u>. It <font color="#245bdb">shows </font>the <u>proportion</u> of residents who <font color="#245bdb">bought</font> fresh or instant coffee, and those that <font color="#245bdb">went</font> to a cafe for coffee or tea in the last four weeks.

- **Tense**: 一般现在，陈述客观事实; 遵照图标里的时态，过去  
- **Paraphrasing**:  原文里的用词进行替换
	- drinking habits = drinking preferences
	- five Australian cities
	- percentage = proportion
- **Framework**: two axes & data groups

According to the chart, most residents in the cities went out for coffee or tea - over 60% in Sydney, Molbourne, and Hovart, and around 55% in Brisbane; these numbers are generally much higher than those of buying fresh or instant coffee. Adelaide is an exception with slightly less than half of its people going out, also one or two percent lower than buying instant coffee.

- Why grouping?
- Internal Comm & <font color="#ff0000">diff</font>
- External Comm & <font color="#ff0000">diff</font>

对于第二组数据，已经和外部比较过了，所以核心是内部比较共性和差异

Among those who bought coffee, around half (45%-55%) of people in the cities bought instant coffee; on the other hand, fewer people bought fresh coffee though the difference varied: from a few percent in Sydney and Melbourne to about half the number of those who bought instant coffee in Brisbane, Adelaide, and Hobart.

- Tense
- Why grouping - 都是买咖啡自己
- Internal Comm&diff -
	- 共性：


对小作文-说清楚数据里的内容 TA就有7  
在这之外是整体上得出的结论，故静态图里conclusion视为bonus  
整体解读可以加于结尾  
两组数据整体呈现出的共性是什么?  

In conclusion, most residents in the five Australian cities drink coffee or tea, and they seem to prefer convenient ways of drinking (coffee or tea from a shop or instant coffee) to making their own drink (fresh coffee).  

大部分买的都是方便咖啡，最后一段超出TA范畴，可以不写

### Pie Chart 饼状图

比起柱状图好写一点，更加直观  
同样——

有个特性——非常直观  
一眼看出有很大共性，看TV和radio占大多数

**Summary**
- What's the framework?

The pie charts show the principal ways of finding out the news in two different countries, the UK and Brazil. The two nations shows broadly similar patterns, though there are some differences, both significant and minor.  
饼图显示了在英国和巴西这两个不同国家发现新闻的主要方法。这两个国家显示出大致相似的模式，尽管存在一些显著和微小的差异。

接下来讲相同和不同——  

**Group 1**
- Why grouping (commonality)?
- Comparison and key features

One of the most prominent features shared by the two pies is that apparently viewing TV news is popular in both countries - with about two fifths of the UK population favoring this mode of delivery and only 3% fewer in Brazil; in the meantime, in the UK over a third of people access the news online, while in Brazil the figure is more than half at 53%.

**Group 2**
- Why grouping (commonality)?
- Comparison and key features

Differences between the UK and Brazil include: 1. over twice as many prople read the news in print in the former, compared with the latter, at 15% and 6% respectively; 2. Similarly, listening to the news on the radio is preferred by three times more people in the UK than in Brazil, though both counting for a minor share of the whole population.

Overall, both countries are dominated by internet and TV in the way how news is conveyed, while the UK has a bit more diversity in how people access news.

分析：
- signal 人群的贫困率相比之下比couple要高
- 有孩子的贫困率比没孩子的要高
- 按年龄，老年人的贫困率低

饼状图更直观，所以可用weight 直接ly  
在一组数据中  
寻找共性和共同点  
把这一组分好类的数据和另一组数据对比，找异同点
