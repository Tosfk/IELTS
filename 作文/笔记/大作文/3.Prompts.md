### 小练习：判断核心议题和讨论的问题

>Some students choose to <font color="#00b0f0">work</font> or <font color="#ff0000">travel</font> after <span style="background:#fff88f">leaving school and before going to university</span>. Many people, however, say that <font color="#00b0f0">working experience</font> is more <span style="background:#fff88f">useful in adult life</span> than <font color="#ff0000">traveling</font>.   
>Do you agree or disagree with this statement?

- ~~Evaluation~~
- gap 旅行对学生吗

Comparison  
比较解决问题的方法

需要明确回答  


>Some cities have vehicle-free days, when private cars, trucks, and motorcycles are <font color="#ff0000">banned from the city center</font>. Public transportation like buses, taxis and metros are advised.   
><span style="background:#fff88f">To what extent do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?</span>

- ~~comparison~~  
是否要再vehicle-free days禁止机动车进入市中心

>Some people argues that <span style="background:#fff88f">the best way</span> to become successful in life is to get the university education. Others disagree and reckon that nowadays it is no longer true.  
>Discuss both views and give your opinion.

- Evaluation
- 现在学历是否还重要

双边意见相悖，  
本体要是从不同角度回答，核心议题会发生变化  
 
YES：  
Is university education a highly effective way for most common people to become successful in life?  
话题变为某项措施是否能解决某些问题

此时变为——  
**Evaluation on an issue/action**  
Career development  
Socia/communication  
Personal achievement

NO：  
Why no the best?  
What are the drawbacks?  
What are the better ways?  

从评估有效性，变成了否定命题并给出证据  
**Justification**

YES & NO：  
Good for long, but notnecessarily for the future  
贴合事实，字数也能撑起来  


“It's the core that matters, NOT how the question is framed.”

也就是观点类作文题型和核心议题并不一一对应

## Analysis 分析报告 20%
只存在一种题型和核心议题

>The level of noise around us is constantly increasing, and is affecting the quality of our lives. What causes the noise?   
>What should be doneabout it?

**Causes** / Effects / **Solutions**

>Despite better access to education, many adults today still cannot read or write. In what ways are they disadvantaged? What can governments do to help them?

文盲问题对人的影响，和政府应该做些什么来帮助他们  
Causes / **Effects** / **Solutions**  
注意话题的普适性

>In today's world, people spend a lot of money on appearance because they want to look younger. 
>Why does this happen? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?

**Causes** / **Effects** / Solutions

近几年出过**非典型**题型：  
Outliers：  
Figures show that some countries have an ever-increasing（不断增长的） proportion of the population who are aged 15 and younger. What do you think are the current and future effects of this may be for the countries?  
并非三者取二  
而是两个effect

Ambition is a positive quality for people to have in many societies today. How important it is for people who want to succeed in life? ls it a positive or negative characteristic?  
更像eva，不成体系，零星出现

## justification -10%
是否同意和一个社会问题相关的话题 
> The only reason for people working hardis to earn money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


否定努力工作只为挣钱  
Diversity in value  
- Achieve excellence
- Pursue inspiration
- Subsistence /responsibility
- Financial return

对比老话题：  
>Everyone should stay in school until theyreach the age of 18. **To what extent do you agree or disagree**?

从优缺点角度考虑：  
Better study  
More disciplined  
More social  
...

Lack ofpractice  
Less social  
Bad food  
....

so——  
**Justify**  
**Proved an opinion to be correct and reasonable**

Many people feel that most of the urgentproblems can be solved by international cooperation.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

从社会实际角度出发，对国际形势有一定了解
