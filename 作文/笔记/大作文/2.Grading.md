| 5   | The writer **expresses a position**                                                   |
| 6   | A **position** is presented that is **directly relevant** to the prompt               |

| 8   | 8 A **clear and well-developed position** is presented in response to the question/s. |



A "position" serves as the central idea around which your entire essay is built.  
You can use phrases such as "**in my opinion**", "**I believe that**".   "**It is my view that**" to make it explicit. ——引出立场

for Agree or disagree：  
- 完全赞同，部分赞同，完全反对，部分反对

for Discuss both views and give your own opinion  
- 有倾向性的立场可以接受，只要论述一致即可。Discuss both views and give your own opinion

for What causes this phenomenon  
- 先分析原因和个现象之间的关系

论点最好是有倾向性，  
主体已有清晰论证  
写出一个清晰且不重复的结论点，总结分论点

<br />

A "conclusion" is necessary but don't simply repeat your position.

1. Summarise the main points in a different way
2. Broaden the perspective
3. Avoid new information, e.g. new examples/ideas
4. Keep it concise and well-written。 不要超过50个词



### 1.3 清晰的论点
写作中分论点的提出以及呈现  
8 Ideas are relevant, well extended and supported. There may be occasional omissions or lapses in content.

7 Main ideas are extended and supported but there may be a tendency to overgeneralize or there may be a lack of focus and precision in supporting ideas/material.

6 Main ideas are relevant, but some may be insufficiently developed or may lackclarity, while some supporting arguments and evidence may be less relevant orinadequate.

5 Some main ideas are put forward, but they are limited and are not sufficientlydeveloped and/or there may be irrelevant detail. There may be some repetitior

**relevant：**
- Analyze the prompt
- Plan your essay
- Stay on topic

**extended supported：**
- Deductive Reasoning
- Inductive Reasoning
- Cause-and-Effect Analysis
- Exemplification
- Compare and Contrast
- Counter-argument and Rebuttal

（道理论证和举例论证写好，7分就有  ）


### 1.4 常见论证方法

#### 1.4.1 三段式论证：Deductive Reasoning
大前提 小前提 结论  
e.g.   

Major Premise:
- sustainable and efficient modes of transport 
- reduce traffic congestion

Minor Premise:
- Free public transportation
- encourage more people to use it

Thesis (conclusion):
- government should provide free public transportation as an effective strategy

<br />

#### 1.4.2 归纳式论证： Inductive Reasoning
经验的集合，若大多数事物都是这样，那这个事情基本也是这样  
Prompt:  
Some people think that the best way to reduce traffic congestion is that the government should provide free public transportation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?  
证明他的成绩是最好的，那放出所有人的成绩，若都没有他好，那他就是最好的  
但也要小心黑天鹅  

#### 1.4.3 [最常用]分析原因和结果：Cause-and-Effect Analysis

>"Main ideas" are the central of each paragraph that needs to be relevant, extended and supported.

<br />

Causes:
- rapid development of digital technology and the need for more accessible education

Situation:
- increased Technology Use in Education

Effects
- Students can access educational materials and lectures
- Technology provides a wide range of educational tools such as videos

<br />

#### 1.4.4 [常用] 给例子，举例论证 Exemplification

Technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, making it faster, more convenient and more accessible

具象化例子:  
For example, a student studying abroad can easily keep **in touch with** their parents back home, reducing feelings of homesickness and ensuring a constant support system.


#### 1.4.5 Compare and Contrast 对比论证
City jobs usually pay better on average but cost of living is also higher.

Countryside work can offer a stronger sense of community and less competition.

#### 1.4.6 驳论 Counter-argument and Rebuttal
Some might argue that building more roads is necessary to meet the growing demand for transportation.  

However, building more roads often leads to a phenomenon known as "induced demand." This means that as more roads are built, more people start using cars, and the congestion problem eventually returns.  

#### 1.4.7 扣分点  
8 There may be occasional omissions（省略） or lapses（失误） in content.
7 a tendency to over-generalize or a lack of focus and precision in supporting ideas/material.   
6 Main ideas may be insufficiently developed or lack clarity, evidence may be less relevant or inadequate.   
5 Main ideas are limited and are not sufficiently developed and/or there may be irrelevant detail. There may be some repetition.  


Avoid irrelevant ideas and details


>Have a comprehensive understanding of the task and the topic: sufficiently respond  
>Use the correct format to give opinions and justify them  
 >Give a clear position  
 >Give a clear conclusion  
>Present, extend and support relevant main ideas  
>Avoid irrelevant ideas and details

| 5   | **Organization is evident** but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. Nevertheless, there is a sense of **underlying coherence** to the response. The **relationship of ideas can be followed** but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other. |

<br />

在一个段落内部分为  

**Topic sentence**
- presents the main idea that the paragraph will discuss 
- gives a clear indication of what to expect in the rest of the paragraph

**Supporting sentences**
- clarify the topic sentence 
- Explanations + examples + statistics (optional)

**Concluding Sentence (Optional)**
- sums up the paragraph
- may also provide a link to the next paragraph

>Some believe that people today have no interest in maintaining the traditional culture of their country or region. Others believe that it is still important to people that we preserve a traditional way of life.

>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

It is easy to argue that people are **strongly influenced by the effects of globalization**. For instance, many people now prefer listening to music by Ed Sheeran or Beyoncé rather than **the traditional music of their country**, which is often seen as outdated by Comparison..
However, it would be **a mistake to think that everyone thinks this way**.... Ed Sheeran, for example, **embodies many musical traditions**, such as folk music and busking. In the same way, it is still common to see performances of more traditional forms of music, such as classical and jazz.

评分标准  
8
A wide resource is fluently and flexibly used to convey precise meanings   
7  
The resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and precision.  
6  
The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task.   
The meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice.  
If the writer is a **risk-taker**, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy.  
5  
The resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task. Simple vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit much variation in expression. There may be frequent lapses in the appropriacy of word choice and a lack of flexibility is apparent infrequent simplifications and/or repetitions.
