The line graphs display changes in the persentage of housesholds with electrial appliances and in the number of hours spent on housework in a country form 1920 to 2019.
In 1920, ownership of washing machines, refrigerators, and vacuum cleaners were **at** approximately 40%, 30%, and 2%, **respectively**. Refrigerators and vacuum cleaners ownership then **increased rapidly** **throughout** the next 60 years, **reaching** 100% for refrigerators and 90% for vacuum cleaners **by** 1980. Ownership of washing machines **also** rose quickly at first, but **levelled off** after reaching 70% in 1960. By 2019, it had **climbed to** only 72%, **compared to** 100% ownership for both refrigerator and vacuum cleaners.
By contrast, the amount of time spent on housework began at 50 hours per week in 1920, and then dropped sharply throughout the next 40 years until it hit 20 hours in 1960. From there, the amount of housework decreased **moderately**, **bottoming out** at **roughly** 11 hours per week in 2019. 
To summarise, the percentage of households which owned electrical appliances **increased significantly** over the years, **while** the amount of time spent on housework decreased **considerably** during the same period.
