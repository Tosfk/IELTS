长难句：

It was an incredible achievement by any standard – made even more remarkable by the fact that he did this during a period considered to be one of the strongest in the sport’s history, competing against the likes of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, to name just a few.

无论以何种标准衡量，这都是一项令人难以置信的成就——更引人注目的是，他在被认为是这项运动历史上最强大的时期之一做到了这一点，与拉斐尔·纳达尔、罗杰·费德勒和诺瓦克·德约科维奇等人竞争，仅举几例。
拆解

It was an incredible achievement by any standard 
– made even more remarkable by the fact that 
he did this during a period considered to be one of the strongest in the sport’s history, 
competing against the likes of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, to name just a few.

例如，美国职业选手皮特·桑普拉斯的发球能力很大程度上归功于他在球拍上增加了四到五个领先砝码，如今许多职业选手在制造过程中都调整了砝码。

For example, 
much of the serving power（发球能力） of US professional player Pete Sampras 
was attributed to the addition of four to five lead weights（领先砝码） onto his rackets, 
and  today many professionals have the weight adjusted during the manufacturing process.
